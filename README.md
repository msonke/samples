# Samples

## What is this repo?

Ultimately this is an opportunity to practice applying my python // javascript skills into web development frameworks.

This is intended to both showcase Proof of Concept, as well as serve as a reference for future projects.  As such, there will be more documentation than normal in order to become a tool to add various components, as well as possibly templates that will be used to quickly build for client driven products.

I also intend on using this repo specifically for testing purposes.
