This is a place for React notes.

// Place this into the README file when finished and organize for readability.

Ctrl + / to comment out multiple lines
Alt + Up/Down to move lines up or down

npx create-react-app <project name>  // this will create the folder, so don't create it

cd into folder
npm start
localhost:3000
ctrl+c to stop

npm run build to compile the site for deployment

package.json holds the dependencies
src is where you work mainly
public has the single index.html file

npm install to install all dependencies


add components folder into src folder
you're building a component tree
a component is just a JS function

lowercase is html elements, Uppercase is defined by you/React

ctrl+shift+i to quickly format

css code is standard, not special



=== Arrow Function ===

function functionName(object); == const functionName = (object) => {};

=== Props ===

Allows for reusable data from component to components

Split the components into smaller building blocks

=== Event Listeners ===

use on as a special prop instead of normal HTML Listeners
They want a function as a value

Import useState from react when you want to use stateful components
useState wants an initial variable

Whenever you update state but you depend on a previous state, 
you should not use individual state, but pass that function to another.

/*
    setUserInput((prevState)) => {
        return {...prevState, newState: event.target.value}
    };
*/

You can prevent the default behaviours with event.preventDefault();
